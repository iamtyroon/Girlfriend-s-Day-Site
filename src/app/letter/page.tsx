You were sent to me. Meeting you is probably a canon event. I don't know if you're from the future or just my favorite glitch in the simulation, but either way — I'm glad it's you. You call me a Golden Retriever (and I'm still wagging my metaphorical tail 😅), and you somehow always say the right things, leaving me blushing like a kid with a crush every single time.\n\nWe've built something beautiful—one conspiracy theory, one anime recommendation, one spontaneous deep talk at a time—and I wouldn't trade it for the world. Thank you for being you: funny, brilliant, and the one person who can make my day just by saying \"Good morning.\"\n\nHere's to more adventures—both planned and wildly spontaneous.\n\nWith all my love,\nTesfa ❤️",
