## 🌸 About This Project
This isn’t just a website — it’s a **digital bouquet**.  
A celebration of **Girlfriend’s Day**, created for one person and one person only: **Praise**.  

From pixel flowers blooming on load to retro game-inspired sections, every part of this site was made to capture the things you love:
- 🎭 Musicals like *Hamilton*  
- 🌸 Flowers in every shade of purple  
- 🧸 Soft teddy bear vibes  
- 💌 Love letters typed out like an old RPG  
- 📆 A countdown to our own special “forever”
